	abstract = {Background This study proposes and validates a method of measuring {3D} strain in myocardium using a {3D} Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance ({CMR)} tissue-tagging sequence and a {3D} optical flow method ({OFM).} Methods Initially, a {3D} tag {MR} sequence was developed and the parameters of the sequence and {3D} {OFM} were optimized using phantom images with simulated deformation. This method then was validated in-vivo and utilized to quantify normal sheep left ventricular functions. Results Optimizing imaging and {OFM} parameters in the phantom study produced sub-pixel root-mean square error ({RMS)} between the estimated and known displacements in the x ({RMSx} = 0.62 pixels (0.43 mm)), y ({RMSy} = 0.64 pixels (0.45 mm)) and z ({RMSz} = 0.68 pixels (1 mm)) direction, respectively. In-vivo validation demonstrated excellent correlation between the displacement measured by manually tracking tag intersections and that generated by {3D} {OFM} (R ≥ 0.98). Technique performance was maintained even with 20\% Gaussian noise added to the phantom images. Furthermore, {3D} tracking of {3D} cardiac motions resulted in a 51\% decrease in in-plane tracking error as compared to {2D} tracking. The in-vivo function studies showed that maximum wall thickening was greatest in the lateral wall, and increased from both apex and base towards the mid-ventricular region. Regional deformation patterns are in agreement with previous studies on {LV} function. Conclusion A novel method was developed to measure {3D} {LV} wall deformation rapidly with high in-plane and through-plane resolution from one {3D} cine acquisition.},

This paper introduces a prone and supine registration method that aims to overcome the difficulties posed by differences in luminal distension and bowel cleansing. The endoluminal surface is iteratively deformed using thin plate spline interpolation in order to increase similarity between prone and supine surfaces. Iterative deformation allows the re-computation of surface curvatures and, therefore, surface features to resemble one another more closely. Therefore, the similarity between surfaces increases with each optimization step when running a subsequent intensity-based registration in cylindrical space. Improved spatial alignment of endoluminal surfaces and better registration accuracies are shown in a limited number of challenging cases.},

It is observed that for well-behaved search spaces, the search efficiency can be improved further by making 'pessimal guesses'. This suggests a style of search in which the region of the search space thought to be close to the optimal solution (on whatever grounds are available) is examined last, while the outlying regions (the pessimal guesses) are examined first.},

	abstract = {We present a novel, variational and statistical approach for shape registration. Shapes of interest are implicitly embedded in a higher-dimensional space of distance transforms. In this implicit embedding space, registration is formulated in a hierarchical manner: the mutual information criterion supports various transformation models and is optimized to perform global registration; then, a B-spline-based incremental free form deformations ({IFFD)} model is used to minimize a sum-of-squared-differences ({SSD)} measure and further recover a dense local nonrigid registration field. The key advantage of such framework is twofold: 1) it naturally deals with shapes of arbitrary dimension ({2D}, {3D}, or higher) and arbitrary topology (multiple parts, closed/open) and 2) it preserves shape topology during local deformation and produces local registration fields that are smooth, continuous, and establish one-to-one correspondences. Its invariance to initial conditions is evaluated through empirical validation, and various hard {2D/3D} geometric shape registration examples are used to show its robustness to noise, severe occlusion, and missing parts. We demonstrate the power of the proposed framework using two applications: one for statistical modeling of anatomical structures, another for {3D} face scan registration and expression tracking. We also compare the performance of our algorithm with that of several other well-known shape registration algorithms},

This paper proposes {TSSC} ({TPS-SURF-SAC-Clustering)} based method of feature point matching and elimination of mismatching. First, Fast-Hessian and Harris operator are utilized to extract the feature points in the initial {MR} image, and the matching region is identified by {TPS} transformation model for every query point in the deformed image. Then the {SURF} descriptors and the proposed Spatial Association Correspondence ({SAC)} method are combined to match the feature points. Finally, by clustering the coordinate differences between the matching points obtained by {TPS-SURF-SAC} and the matching points calculated by {TPS} model, most incorrectly matched points are eliminated. After every iterative processing of matching and mismatching elimination, the updated {TPS} model becomes more accurate and more correctly so that the matched points can be identified than those of last iteration. The experimental results show that the proposed {SAC} was efficient and that {TSSC} based method outperformed the single {SURF} or {SIFT} method.},

This problem has important aplications in biomedical research and instruction, solid modeling, and industrial inspection.
The method we describe produces a triangulated mesh from the data points of the contours which is then used in conjunction with a piecewise parametric surface-fitting algorithm to produce a reconstructed surface.
The problem can be broken into four subproblems: the correspondence problem (which contours should be connected by the surface?), the tiling problem (how should the contours be connected?), the branching  problem (what do we do when there are branches in the surface?), and the surface-fitting problem (what is the precise geometry of the reconstructed surface?) We describe our system for surface reconstruction from sets of contours with respect to each of these subproblems. Special attention is given to the correspondence and branching problems. We present a method that can handle sets of contours in which adjacent contours share a very contorted boundary, and we describe a new approach to solving the correspondence problem using a Minimum Spanning Tree generated from the contours.},

Then two algorithms that generate 3-D surface models are presented. The new methods use polygon and point primitives to interface with computer-aided design equipment.

	abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for reconstructing a subdivision of the three-dimensional space (given arbitrarily-oriented slices of it) into labeled domains. The input to the algorithm is a collection of nonparallel planar cross-sections of an unknown object, where the sections might cover only portions of the supporting planes. (The information in the rest of these planes is, thus, “unknown.”) Each cross-section consists of a partition of the plane into closed labeled (“colored”) domains with no restrictions whatsoever on either their geometries or topologies, and without any assumptions about similarities between partitions of different sections. The problem is to reconstruct the original three-dimensional partition by interpolating simultaneously all the cross-sections, so that planar domains in the input are connected only to other domains of the same color, no two reconstructed spatial domains intersect, and no unnecessary gaps remain between the reconstructed colored {domains.The} problem of reconstructing multiple-labeled domains arises, for example, in medical imaging, where different types of tissues are scanned and reconstructed at the same time. Partial slices are typical, for example, in ultrasound scanning. In this work we use the three-dimensional straight-skeleton of the arrangement of the cross-sections. Since the sections might be partial, cells of the arrangement might be nonconvex. For this we use the unambiguous definition, as well as the implementation of the computation, of the straight skeleton of a three-dimensional polyhedron that we presented in a recent work [{BEGV08].} First, we define these cells and compute their skeleton. Second, we compute overlays of portions of sampled contours in the cross-sections, using the cell skeletons to guide the reconstruction of the mesh.},

Areal bone mineral density ({BMD)} measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ({DXA)} is an established criterion in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. This measure, however, is limited by its two-dimensionality. This work presents a method to reconstruct both the {3D} bone shape and {3D} {BMD} distribution of the proximal femur from a single {DXA} image used in clinical routine. A statistical model of the combined shape and {BMD} distribution is presented, together with a method for its construction from a set of quantitative computed tomography ({QCT)} scans. A reconstruction is acquired in an intensity based {3D-2D} registration process whereby an instance of the model is found that maximizes the similarity between its projection and the {DXA} image. Reconstruction experiments were performed on the {DXA} images of 30 subjects, with a model constructed from a database of {QCT} scans of 85 subjects. The accuracy was evaluated by comparing the reconstructions with the same subject {QCT} scans. The method presented here can potentially improve the diagnosis of osteoporosis and fracture risk assessment from the low radiation dose and low cost {DXA} devices currently used in clinical routine.},

The function is constructed independently inside every cell of the arrangement of the cross-section planes using transfinite interpolation techniques based on barycentric coordinates. These guarantee that the function is smooth, and its zero set interpolates the cross-sections. The algorithm is highly parallelizable and may be implemented as an incremental update as each new cross-section is introduced.

	abstract = {In computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound imaging, reconstruction of the {3D} object from the {2D} scalar-valued slices obtained by the imaging system is difficult because of the large spacings between the {2D} slices. The aliasing that results from this undersampling in the direction orthogonal to the slices leads to two problems, known as the correspondence problem and the tiling problem. A third problem, known as the branching problem, arises because of the structure of the objects being imaged in these applications. Existing reconstruction algorithms typically address only one or two of these problems. In this paper, we approach all three of these problems simultaneously. This is accomplished by imposing a set of three constraints on the reconstructed surface and then deriving precise correspondence and tiling rules from these constraints. The constraints ensure that the regions tiled by these rules obey physical constructs and have a natural appearance. Regions which cannot be tiled by these rules without breaking one or more constraints are tiled with their medial axis (edge Voronoi diagram). Our implementation of the above approach generates triangles of {3D} isosurfaces from input which is either a set of contour data or a volume of image slices. Results obtained with synthetic and actual medical data are presented.

	abstract = {Presents a validation study of an optical-flow method for the rapid estimation of myocardial displacement in magnetic resonance tagged cardiac images. This registration and change visualization ({RCV)} software uses a hierarchical estimation technique to compute the flow field that describes the warping of an image of one cardiac phase into alignment with the next. This method overcomes the requirement of constant pixel intensity in standard optical-flow methods by preprocessing the input images to reduce any intensity bias which results from the reduction in stripe contrast throughout the cardiac cycle. To validate the method, {SPAMM-tagged} images were acquired of a silicon gel phantom with simulated rotational motion. The pixel displacement was estimated with the {RCV} method and the error in pixel tracking was {\textless}4\% 1000 ms after application of the tags, and after 30° of rotation. An additional study was performed using a {SPAMM-tagged} multiphase slice of a canine left ventricle. The true displacement was determined using a previously validated active contour model (snakes). The error between methods was 6.7\% at end systole. The {RCV} method has the advantage of tracking all pixels in the image in a substantially shorter period than the snakes method.},

This is an important problem in medical imaging, surface reconstruction from topographic data, and other applications. We reduce the problem, as in most previous works, to a series of problems of piecewise-linear interpolation between each pair of successive slices. Our algorithm uses a partial curve matching technique for matching parts of the contours, an optimal triangulation of 3-D polygons for resolving the unmatched parts, and a minimum spanning tree heuristic for interpolating between nonsimply connected regions. Unlike previous attempts at solving this problem, our algorithm seems to handle successfully in practice any kind of data. It allows multiple contours in each slice, with any hierarchy of contour nesting, and avoids the introduction of counterintuitive bridges between contours, proposed in some earlier papers to handle interpolation between multiply connected regions. Experimental results on various complex examples, involving actual medical imaging data, are presented and show the good and robust performance of our algorithm.},

Previous work in this area has mostly focused on connecting simple closed curves on parallel cross-sections. Here we consider the more general problem where input data may lie on non-parallel cross-sections and consist of curve networks that represent the segmentation of the underlying object by different material or tissue types (e.g., skin, muscle, bone, etc.) on each cross-section. The desired output is a surface network that models both the exterior surface and the internal partitioning of the object. We introduce an algorithm that is capable of handling curve networks of arbitrary shape and topology on cross-section planes with arbitrary orientations. Our algorithm is simple to implement and is guaranteed to produce a closed surface network that interpolates the curve network on each cross-section. Our method is demonstrated on both synthetic and bio-medical examples.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to measuring similarity between shapes and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the {COIL} dataset},

The algorithm processes the {3D} medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original {3D} data. Results from computed tomography ({CT)}, magnetic resonance ({MR)}, and single-photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT)} illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

Experimental results show that the geometric representation built using our method can faithfully represent the morphology and topology of vascular structures. In addition, both the qualitative and the quantitative validations have been performed to show that the reconstructed vessel geometry is of high accuracy and smoothness.

To this end, the registration map consists of a linear motion model and a local deformations field, incrementally recovered. In order to demonstrate the performance of the selected representation a simple criterion is considered, the sum of square differences. Empirical validation and promising results were obtained on examples that exhibit large global motion as well as important local deformations and arbitrary topological changes.},

In the paper, we re-assign zero to vertices in the surface and one to vertices on the surface, and then improve the marching cubes algorithm by redefining the configurations for the fifteen cases of configurations proposed in marching cubes method. To evaluate the performance of the improved marching cubes method, we reconstructed the surface for {MRI} volume data using the improved method along with the marching cubes method. The experimental results show that the improved method can remove the disadvantages mentioned above and obtain a satisfying reconstructed surface},

Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated the efficacy of the present method. Compared to the existing work, the present method has the advantage of much shorter computing time and can be applied to both {DXA} images as well as conventional x-ray images, which may hold the potentials to be applied to clinical routine task such as total hip arthroplasty ({THA).}},

This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours. Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. A new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. Also developed is a closed-form expression, in terms of the number of contour points, for an upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm. An illustrated example which involves the construction of a minimum area surface describing a human head is included.},

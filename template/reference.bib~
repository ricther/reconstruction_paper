	abstract = {A particular style of search is considered that is motivated by the problem of reconstructing the surface of three-dimensional objects given a collection of planar contours representing cross-sections through the objects. An improvement on the simple divide-and-conquer method is presented. The key idea is to locate bottlenecks (minimal separators), which markedly reduces the number of searches required but reduces other measures (e.g. nodes expanded) by only a constant factor. It is observed that for well-behaved search spaces, the search efficiency can be improved further by making 'pessimal guesses'. This suggests a style of search in which the region of the search space thought to be close to the optimal solution (on whatever grounds are available) is examined last, while the outlying regions (the pessimal guesses) are examined first.},

	abstract = {We present a novel, variational and statistical approach for shape registration. Shapes of interest are implicitly embedded in a higher-dimensional space of distance transforms. In this implicit embedding space, registration is formulated in a hierarchical manner: the mutual information criterion supports various transformation models and is optimized to perform global registration; then, a B-spline-based incremental free form deformations ({IFFD)} model is used to minimize a sum-of-squared-differences ({SSD)} measure and further recover a dense local nonrigid registration field. The key advantage of such framework is twofold: 1) it naturally deals with shapes of arbitrary dimension ({2D}, {3D}, or higher) and arbitrary topology (multiple parts, closed/open) and 2) it preserves shape topology during local deformation and produces local registration fields that are smooth, continuous, and establish one-to-one correspondences. Its invariance to initial conditions is evaluated through empirical validation, and various hard {2D/3D} geometric shape registration examples are used to show its robustness to noise, severe occlusion, and missing parts. We demonstrate the power of the proposed framework using two applications: one for statistical modeling of anatomical structures, another for {3D} face scan registration and expression tracking. We also compare the performance of our algorithm with that of several other well-known shape registration algorithms},

Existing methods of 3-D display generate images based on the distance from an imaginary observation point to a patch on the surface and on the surface normal of the patch. We believe that the normalized gradient of the original values in the {CT} or {MRI} tomograms provides a better estimate for the surface normal and hence results in higher quality 3-D images. Then two algorithms that generate 3-D surface models are presented. The new methods use polygon and point primitives to interface with computer-aided design equipment. Finally, several 3-D images of both bony and soft tissue show the skull, spine, internal air cavities of the head and abdomen, and the abdominal aorta in detail.},

	abstract = {The accurate diagnosis of osteoporosis has gained increasing importance due to the aging of our society. Areal bone mineral density ({BMD)} measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ({DXA)} is an established criterion in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. This measure, however, is limited by its two-dimensionality. This work presents a method to reconstruct both the {3D} bone shape and {3D} {BMD} distribution of the proximal femur from a single {DXA} image used in clinical routine. A statistical model of the combined shape and {BMD} distribution is presented, together with a method for its construction from a set of quantitative computed tomography ({QCT)} scans. A reconstruction is acquired in an intensity based {3D-2D} registration process whereby an instance of the model is found that maximizes the similarity between its projection and the {DXA} image. Reconstruction experiments were performed on the {DXA} images of 30 subjects, with a model constructed from a database of {QCT} scans of 85 subjects. The accuracy was evaluated by comparing the reconstructions with the same subject {QCT} scans. The method presented here can potentially improve the diagnosis of osteoporosis and fracture risk assessment from the low radiation dose and low cost {DXA} devices currently used in clinical routine.},

The algorithm has the unique ability to handle cross-sections in which regions are classified as being inside the object, outside the object, or unknown. This is achieved by constructing a scalar function on R3, whose zero set is the desired surface. The function is constructed independently inside every cell of the arrangement of the cross-section planes using transfinite interpolation techniques based on barycentric coordinates. These guarantee that the function is smooth, and its zero set interpolates the cross-sections. The algorithm is highly parallelizable and may be implemented as an incremental update as each new cross-section is introduced. This leads to an efficient online version, performed on a {GPU}, which is suitable for interactive medical applications.},

This is an important problem in medical imaging, surface reconstruction from topographic data, and other applications. We reduce the problem, as in most previous works, to a series of problems of piecewise-linear interpolation between each pair of successive slices. Our algorithm uses a partial curve matching technique for matching parts of the contours, an optimal triangulation of 3-D polygons for resolving the unmatched parts, and a minimum spanning tree heuristic for interpolating between nonsimply connected regions. Unlike previous attempts at solving this problem, our algorithm seems to handle successfully in practice any kind of data. It allows multiple contours in each slice, with any hierarchy of contour nesting, and avoids the introduction of counterintuitive bridges between contours, proposed in some earlier papers to handle interpolation between multiply connected regions. Experimental results on various complex examples, involving actual medical imaging data, are presented and show the good and robust performance of our algorithm.},

In the paper, we re-assign zero to vertices in the surface and one to vertices on the surface, and then improve the marching cubes algorithm by redefining the configurations for the fifteen cases of configurations proposed in marching cubes method. To evaluate the performance of the improved marching cubes method, we reconstructed the surface for {MRI} volume data using the improved method along with the marching cubes method.

Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated the efficacy of the present method.

This paper presents a general solution to the problem of constructing a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours. Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. A new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. Also developed is a closed-form expression, in terms of the number of contour points, for an upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm. An illustrated example which involves the construction of a minimum area surface describing a human head is included.},

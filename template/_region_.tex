% Template for Elsevier CRC journal article
% version 1.2 dated 09 May 2011

% This file (c) 2009-2011 Elsevier Ltd.  Modifications may be freely made,
% provided the edited file is saved under a different name

% This file contains modifications for Procedia Computer Science
% but may easily be adapted to other journals

% Changes since version 1.1
% - added "procedia" option compliant with ecrc.sty version 1.2a
%   (makes the layout approximately the same as the Word CRC template)
% - added example for generating copyright line in abstract

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%% This template uses the elsarticle.cls document class and the extension package ecrc.sty
%% For full documentation on usage of elsarticle.cls, consult the documentation "elsdoc.pdf"

%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
%% Add the 'procedia' option to approximate to the Word template
%\documentclass[3p,times,procedia]{elsarticle}
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subcaption}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.  Contact the journal editorial office if in any doubt
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Provide the copyright line to appear in the abstract
%% Usage:
%   \CopyrightLine[<text-before-year>]{<year>}{<restt-of-the-copyright-text>}
%   \CopyrightLine[Crown copyright]{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
%% \usepackage{amsthm}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
%% \usepackage{lineno}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%
%% \biboptions{comma,round}

%%the technique is very important for real applications
The request for reconstruction objects from planar cross
sections arises in various applications, such as medical
science,3D-Printing, and CAD/CAM.
%%simply introduction for 3D reconstruction based on 2D cross-sections
The procedure of 3D reconstruction based on the 2D cross-sections usually consist of data acquisition, correspondence decision and surface fitting. With the improvements in data
acquisition and imagine techniques like MRI, CT and ultrasound
imaging, it's easy to get a sequence of 2D cross-sections which represent
the object. The correspondence problem can subdivide into two steps,
global correspondence and local correspondence. Global correspondence
decide the portions connection, which solves the branching
problem or many-to-many case Fig.\ref{fig:global}. And the local correspondence decide how
to stitch the adjacent corresponding contours together,like
Fig.\ref{fig:local}. An automatic solution of the correspondence is
very difficult in its general form. The surface fitting step will
generate a smooth surface, and is another hot topic in computer
graphics.
%%this paper's aim
This paper concentrates on the correspondence problem, all of which
works on the 2D planar cross sections and proceed by calculating the
corresponding points in adjacent cross-sections. Once the
corresponding points are extracted, object surface can be quickly
rendered by various classic algorithms.
